/*Problem 2: [12 points]
We are going to represent the game board with
a class name GameBoard. It will contain a 
2D array of BoardSquare objects.

Create a class named GameBoard with the following:
- member field to represent number of rows on the board
- member field to represent number of columns on the board
   (rows start at top of board with row 0 - 
    columns start at left side of board with column 0)
- member field to represent all the spaces on the board – 
    this should be a 2 dimensional array of BoardSquare objects
- constructor with two parameters in this order:
    - number of rows
    - number of columns 
    - this constructor should set these member fields
     and set the 2D array member field to an empty array 
- accessors
    - getNumRows, getNumColumns, getAllSquares
- accessor
    - getSquare that has one parameter of type Location and returns
    the BoardSquare at that location's row and column
- a method named inBounds with two parameters:
    - row index and column index (in that order) representing the location of a 
    square on the game board and returns a boolean value representing whether 
    the location of this space is within the bounds of the board 
    (For example:  inBounds(5,5) should return false for any board
          with more than 6 rows or more than 6 columns)
- private method named setUpEmptyBoard with no parameters and no return value
    - This method creates a BoardSquare object for each location 
    in the 2 dimensional array of BoardSquares.  
    Use nested loops! You should alternate colors between black and white.
    You should start the color of the board in
    row 0 and col 0 to black and then row 0 col 1 to white.
    NOTE: after completing this method - add a statement to your 
    constructor to call this setUpEmptyBoard method
    After you have done this - see the bottom of the file for code
    that will create a GameBoard and display the colors so you can
    debug.
    HINT: All even rows will start with black and 
    all odd rows will start with white
- method named isBoardFull that has no parameters and returns a boolean
    representing whether there are no empty squares on the board
    NOTE: This is SIMILAR LOGIC TO WEEK_2_3 function boardFull
- method named findRandomEmptySquare with no parameters and 
   returns a BoardSquare. This method should call 
   getRandomInt() method (already written for you)
   to generate random row and column indexes
   if this location on the Board is empty – it should return this BoardSquare,
   if not, it should repeat the process until it finds an empty space. 
   NOTE: This is SIMILAR LOGIC TO WEEK_2_3 function findRandomEmptySquare
- method toString() is already defined for you
